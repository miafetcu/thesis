            <h2>About the Study</h2>
            <p>The project is focusing on a two-year study to investigate the impact of solar panels on the energy consumption of a normal family home, located in the city of Nisporeni, in the Codri area of Moldova. This study is focused on a home that is 130 square meters in size and has a roof that has 70 square meters of solar capacity.</p>
